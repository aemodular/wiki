I have my AE Modular since begin of 2024. It is my first modular synthesiser. It is totally different to make sounds with it, compared with instruments like guitar, keyboard or drums. I also use Studio One DAW with a lot of plug-ins to create music, but the haptic of a computer and the haptic of a modular synthesiser are two different worlds. 

Since I find AE Modular at the internet I am on fire. There are a lot of new ideas for new modules and functions, but it needs a long time to come from the idea to a new module at the rack. Currently my focus is more at my DIY modules than on making music.

I have programmed a lot of different music on my computer. Currently I haven’t published it. Maybe I will do it in future.
