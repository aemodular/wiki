# JcAspes

Hello, I'm JcAspes! I'm from Lyon, an iconic French city of electronic music.
I discovered electronic music production while studying computer science in 1998, spending long evenings using software such as Propellerhead Rebirth with friends. I then dreamed of owning a Yamaha RMX1 but no money for students!, and the years went by.
But one fine day in a design museum, I discovered an inexpensive pocket operator from Teenage Engineering, and my dreams of music machines resurfaced, so I bought a PO-32 (drum machine) and a PO-33 (sampler). I played around with them, searched for other musicians on the internet, read forums... discovered VCV Rack software.... played with and wanted real knobs and wires! Then an apparition on the internet, TangibleWaves which released the AE Modular synthesizer! It was affordable, I had to have it! I could finally do modular at home! Well, sometimes my kids and wife beg me to turn off the sound system and put on my headphones :-)  but I have good headphones! Let's do music !
