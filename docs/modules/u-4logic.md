This 1/3 height micro module provides various logic gates and inverted functions. There are 4 channels for logic operations, two channels for two signals to be combined using either NAND, AND or XOR logic and two channels for inverting a signal.

This module needs to be placed on a carrier for micro modules, like  [[u-base.md | µBASE]],  [[u-base_qs2.md | µBASE QS2]]!

Module power consumption: ? mA

This module works exactly like the bigger [[logic.md| LOGIC]] module. Please check its wiki page for more information, and patch suggestions.
