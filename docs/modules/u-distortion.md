This 1/3 height micro module provides a distortion effect for the incoming audio signal.

This module needs to be placed on a carrier for micro modules, like  [[u-base.md | µBASE]],  [[u-base_qs2.md | µBASE QS2]]!

Module power consumption: ? mA

## Inputs

* **IN** - the incoming audio signal

## Outputs

* **OUT** - the distorted output audio signal

## Controls

* **DRIVE** Knob - this knob controls the "drive" of the signal, basically it amplifies the signal and overloads the circuits to get the distorted effect.
* **CLIP** Switch - in the upper position it will clip the edges off the distorted signal for further degradation
* **SYMM** - ?
* **HARD** - ?

## Patch Suggestions

This can be used for adding "grit" to a clean sound source. This can be very good on bass or lead sounds.

It can be great to "rough up" a sound with distortion __before__ filtering, especially with the filter resonance in higher settings.
