This 1/3 height micro module provides a two independant channels for a signal amplifier which is very similar to the [[2signalamp.md | 2SIGNALAMP]] module.

This module needs to be placed on a carrier for micro modules, like  [[u-base.md | µBASE]],  [[u-base_qs2.md | µBASE QS2]]!

Module power consumption: ? mA

## Inputs

* **IN 1, IN 2** - inputs for each of the amplifying channels

## Outputs

* **OUT 1, OUT 2** -  outputs for each of the amplifying channels

## Controls

* **LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2** Pot - Level control for how much the relevant signal will be amplified.

## Patch Suggestions

Some modules in the AE system produce very low volume or signal levels, eg. GRAINS, VCO, (particularly the triangle wave), and sometimes the SOLINA . With the SIGNALAMP you can increase the signal of these modules so they can hold their own in a mix with other much stronger signals. Also can be useful to boost heavily filtered audio....
