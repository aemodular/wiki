The uXMIX is the small brother of the XMIX module. It's a combination of
* a three-channel mixer A with level controls; switchable as audio or CV mixer. Inputs 2 and 3 are controlled with one common knob
* a passive three-channel mixer B, equally weighted
* an attenuator with fixed levels
* an analog inverter

This module needs to be placed on a carrier for micro modules, like  [[u-base.md | µBASE]],  [[u-base_qs2.md | µBASE QS2]]!

## Inputs
* **A1** - First input for the A mixer section (attenuated by the A1 knob)
* **A2a** - Second input for the A mixer section (attenuated by the A2 knob)
* **A2b** - Third input for the A mixer section (also attenuated by the A2 knob)
* **B1 - B3** - Inputs for the B mixer section which are all mixed at the same level
* **INV** - The signal on this input will be inverted in the **INV** output
* **.8 - .12** - these are fixed attenuation inputs where each input is mixed together at the given percentage

## Outputs
* **A** - mixed output of channel A
* **B** - mixed output of channel B
* **ATT** - mixed output of the fixed attenuation channel
* **INV** - the inverse signal of the **INV** input

## Controls
* **A1** (knob) - attenuation for the first input to channel A
* **A2** (knob) - attenuation for bot the first and second inputs of channel A
* **IN A AUD/CV** (switch) - switches channel A from audio to CV levels

## Patch Suggestions
This is a multifunction mixer and attenuator and can be used anywhere where you would use either of those.
