The WAEVE82 is not only a polyphonic wavetable oscillator, but actually a complete 8-voice polysynth! It combines the unmistakable charm of early digital wavetable instruments with a modern, performance-oriented workflow and a clear, page-based interface that invites exploration.

Its conceptual DNA is inspired by the PPG Wave 2 synthesizers of the 1980s — iconic instruments known for glassy timbres, animated spectra, and futuristic character.
Yet, the WAEVE82 is far from being a clone. It draws inspiration from that lineage but follows its own path, with a unique audio engine, expanded modulation options, modern randomization tools, and a streamlined interface tailored for the AE modular format.

This module is created in collaboration with Visuelle Musik - Mathias Brüssel; Mathias actually sparked this module with a concept built around a development board.

At its core, WAEVE82 provides:

* Two independent wavetable oscillators, with 64 internal wavetables plus support for external tables loaded from micro-SD card.
* Three envelopes and four LFOs, each with defined primary and secondary roles; LFOs can be free-running or tempo-synced
* Extensive modulation possibilites, enabling both traditional and experimental routing, including a modulation-matrix for assigning MIDI-messages and/or CVs.

Dual operating modes:

* Edit Mode for deep sound design
* Perform Mode for live playability with direct access to eight favorites

Other features:

* A powerful Randomize & Mutate system that generates entirely new sounds or gently transforms sounds while keeping them musical; always with restorable history. 
* Save/load presets from micro-SD card
* Full IMDI/MIDI and CV/Gate integration, including an eight-voice MIDI engine and flexible chord generation from CV
* plus additional CV/Gate inputs for additional control. IMDI and CV control can run parallel.

Module power consumption: 140 mA
