## Overview

* Module format: micro-module
* Power consumption: ??mA

[filename](../../common/micro.md ':include')

Simple &mu;Module comprising a pair or 4 bit counters. Inspired by an element of Matt Keubrich’s *Roundabout* [see here](https://github.com/MattKuebrich/roundabout). The [[/modules/wonkystuff/ur2r.md|&mu;r2r]] also takes inspiration from this source.

## Controls

None

## Connectivity

Inputs and outputs are the same for each counter.

### Inputs

Inputs are triggered by positive-going signals.

* **c** — clock input (increments the 4 bit counter);
* **r** — reset (sets all outputs to '0')

### Outputs

* 4 individual bit outputs.

Each clock input pulse will change the outputs in the following pattern:

    0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 1
    0 0 1 0
    0 0 1 1
    0 1 0 0
    0 1 0 1
    0 1 1 0
    0 1 1 1
    1 0 0 0
    1 0 0 1
    1 0 1 0
    1 0 1 1
    1 1 0 0
    1 1 0 1
    1 1 1 0
    1 1 1 1
