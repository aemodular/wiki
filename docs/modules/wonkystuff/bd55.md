This 1/3 height micro module is a clone of the famous Bass Drum voice from the Boss DR-55. The most popular mods (decay and pitch) have been incorporated into the design for added fun.

This module needs to be installed in a &mu;Module base-module such as the [[ubaselite.md | &mu;BaseLite]], [[/modules/u-base.md | µBASE]], or [[/modules/u-base_qs2.md | µBASE QS2]].
