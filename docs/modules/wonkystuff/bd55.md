## Overview

[filename](../../common/micro.md ':include')

This module is a clone of the Bass Drum voice from the Boss DR-55 drum machine. The most popular mods (decay and pitch) have been incorporated into the design for added flexibility.

## Controls

* **pitch** Changes the pitch of the tone;
* **decay** Changes the duration of the tone, from a click to self-oscillation at the higher end — which does have its uses!

## Connectivity

As a drum voice, this one is fairly self-explanatory!

### Inputs

* **trig** A pair of trigger inputs (1 & 2) are provided which sum so that accented hits can be achieved. Each trigger is actually a pair of sockets acting as a local multiple.

### Outputs

* **out** the audio from the module.
