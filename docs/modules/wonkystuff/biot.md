## Overview

* Module format: single-width, full height
* Power consumption: 0mA (completely passive, no power connector)

This is a simple touch plate module, a slightly jazzed up version of touching the ends of cables with your fingers! It works for both audio and CV signals, enabling the user to mix signals based on the conductivity of their own skin (signals get louder in times of stress!). It is great to add a bit of variation to any modulation as you move/press your finger (or whatever else you fancy running over the touch plates!); can be nice on filter cut off too.

The original edition, in white and silver, was limited to an edition of 50 (25 via Hot Air, 25 via wonkystuff). Subsequently, there was also a black/gold version, also limited to an edition of 50.

(The panel is double-sided, in case you would like a change of view.)

## Controls

* 8 touch plates, with mystical symbols attached.

Each input/output pairing refers to the touch plate with the same symbol; usually you will do one connection to 2 (or more) different touch plates so your finger(s) make the electrical connection. Experiment!

## Connectivity

Each touch plate has a pair of sockets associated with it, there are no specified *in* or *out* connections, they can be what you want them to be…
