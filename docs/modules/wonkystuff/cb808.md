## Overview

[filename](../../common/micro.md ':include')

The module is a clone of the (in)famous cowbell voice from the Roland TR-808. There is a 'decay' control which adjusts the length of the generated sound for a bit of manual variation.

## Controls

* **decay** Changes the duration of the tone, clockwise gives a slightly softer attack also.

## Connectivity

As a drum voice, this one is fairly self-explanatory!

### Inputs

* **trig** A trigger input is provided as a pair of sockets acting as a local multiple.

### Outputs

* **out** the audio from the module.
