## Overview

## Controls

* **size** changes the artificial 'reverberation' effect on the sound, going from a very dry to a reverberant sound.

## Connectivity

As a drum voice, this one is fairly self-explanatory!

### Inputs

* **trig** A trigger input is provided as a pair of sockets acting as a local multiple.

### Outputs
