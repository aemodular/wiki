## Overview

* Module format: micro-module
* Power consumption: 5mA

[filename](../../common/micro.md ':include')

The module is a clone of the *hand clap* voice from the Boss DR-110 (some say that the DR-110 has the best hand clap sound).

## Controls

* **size** changes the artificial 'reverberation' effect on the sound, going from a very dry to a reverberant sound.

## Connectivity

As a drum voice, this one is fairly self-explanatory!

### Inputs

* **trig** A trigger input is provided as a pair of sockets (acting as a local multiple).

### Outputs

* **out** the audio from the module.
