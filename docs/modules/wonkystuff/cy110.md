## Overview

The module is a clone of the *cymbal* voice from the Boss DR-110. The sound generation and shaping follows the same method as the original (digital noise and summed square waves, with analogue envelope and VCA) — a *classic* electro-cymbal.

## Controls

* **decay** changes the length of the sound, from a short 'open hihat'-like sound, to a longer, splashier sound.

## Connectivity

As a drum voice, this one is hopefully self-explanatory!

### Inputs

* **trig** A pair of trigger inputs (1 & 2) are provided which sum so that accented hits can be achieved. Each trigger is actually a pair of sockets acting as a local multiple.

### Outputs

* **out** the audio from the module.
