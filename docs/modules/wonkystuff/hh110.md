## Overview

* Module format: micro-module
* Power consumption: ??mA

[filename](../../common/micro.md ':include')

The module is a clone of the *hihat* voice from the Boss DR-110. The sound generation and shaping follows the same method as the original (digital noise and summed square waves, with analogue envelope and VCA) — triggering both open and closed sounds simultaneously gives a third sonic permutation.

## Controls

* **oh decay** changes the length of the open hihat sound.

## Connectivity

As a drum voice, this one is hopefully self-explanatory!

### Inputs

Each trigger is actually a pair of sockets acting as a local multiple.

* **oh** triggers the open hihat sound.
* **ch** triggers the closed hihat sound.

Triggering both open and closed sounds simultaneously gives an 'in-between' variation.

### Outputs

* **out** the audio from the module.
