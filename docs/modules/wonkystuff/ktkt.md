## Overview

Something for the more 'hands-on' users, this module contains a contact microphone mounted to the rear of the front panel, allowing scrapes and taps to control other parts of your system. Version 2 of the module added an external jack *high impedance input* is provided for external contact mics to be used instead of the internal mic (it also works for guitar!).

The module also has a fixed envelope-follower fed from the microphone input which can be used to control another module (e.g. the gain of a VCA).

## Controls

* **mic** controls the gain of the microphone signal (from 0x to 10x);
* **env** controls the sensitivity of the envelope-follower. Note that this is follows from the mic stage - if the mic volume is low, then the envelope-follower has less signal to work on.

## Connectivity

Connections are not too complicated!

### Inputs

* *TRS jack socket* input to the high-impedance microphone pre-amp for external sources. Note that this is *not* ground-referenced, it is intended for floating sources such as microphones, guitars etc. - not for other powered audio sources. Unpredictable (interesting?) results may occur!

### Outputs

* **mic** The audio signal output from the mic pre-amp. The level is controlled by the *mic* control;
* **env** The output from the envelope-follower. The level is controlled by the combination of the *mic* and *env* controls.
