## Overview

* Module format: double-width, full height
* Power consumption: ??mA

mm33+ is a 3x3 matrix mixer usable for both audio and CV signals. It's an updated version of the very first third-party module for AE Modular.

The original mm33 3x3 matrix mixer was the *very first* 3rd-party module for the Tangible Waves AE Modular synthesiser system, so an update is just about due! The main differences from the original mm33 are as follows:

* The module now uses surface mount components, so it's a little bit neater;
* Each output channel now has a switch to select whether the output is targetted for CV or audio (CV signals are relative to 0v, whilst audio signals are centred around 2.5v).
* Gain for each channel has been increased to improve the behaviour when using the mm33+ within feedback patches — this is especially useful when switched to the audio output mode. Because of the new CV/Audio switches, there are no longer any AC coupled inputs, but we're confident that they won't be missed

## Controls

* **mix controls (x9)** - adjusts the mix of signals between inputs (*I,II,III*) and outputs (*x,y,z*).

## Connectivity

The purpose of the matrix mixer is to create three different mixes of the input signals. Inputs are mapped to each row, whilst outputs are mapped to each column.

### Inputs

* **I II III** Audio or CV inputs. The signals map to each row of the controller matrix, indicated by the number of lines on that row.

### Outputs

* **x y z** Seperate mixes of the input signals.
