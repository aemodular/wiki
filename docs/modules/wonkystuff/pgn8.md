Inspired by the [Czochralski Cells instrument by Destiny+](https://www.destiny-plus.com/czochralski-cells), this module creates pulse/trigger/gate outputs based on simple input signals. Primarily aimed at generative approaches, the pgn/8 produces complexity from simplicity.

By applying different LFOs (or signals with phase differences), different patterns of triggers and/or gates can be generated, leading to emergent rhythms or other generative artefacts.

## Controls

None.

## Connectivity

All inputs and outputs are digital (high/low).

### Inputs

* **index** (x3) (top pins): Select which pin to set 'high'. A simple binary index, 000-111 mapping from top to bottom;
* **disable**  — drive all outputs low:
  * low-disable (**?** input)
  * high-disable (**&iquest;** input)

### Outputs

* 8x trigger/gate outputs
