## Overview

* Module format: single-width, full height
* Power consumption: ??mA

This module is a clone of the Snare Drum (SD) voice from the Boss DR-110 drum machine. Controls have been added to allow the sound to be sculpted somewhat — the pitch of the drum-body, the decay of the snare rattle, and the balance between the two parts of the sound.

## Controls

* **body tone** controls the pitch of the drum body, equivalent to tuning the drum skin itself;
* **noise decay** controls the 'tightness' of the snare's noise burst, from a taut snap to a loose splash.
* **balance** controls the balance of the mixed sound between the tone and noise components.

## Connectivity

A single trigger input is provided to kick off the snare.

### Inputs

* **T** A trigger input is provided as a pair of sockets (acting as a local multiple).

### Outputs

* **SD** the mixed 'complete' snare tone, as adjusted by the *balance* control;
* **D** the body tone on its own;
* **S** the snare sound on its own

***Note*** *The *D* and *S* outputs are out of phase with respect to the *SD* output, so some interesting phase cancellation effects can be achieved here!*
