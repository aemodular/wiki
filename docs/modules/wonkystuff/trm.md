## Overview

* Module format: single-width, full height
* Power consumption: ??mA

Old-school, transformer-based Ring Modulator available as a kit (with, or without transformers) as well as fully-assembled. Transformers are standard 'Eagle' LT-44 (aka P631M) in case you are looking at the 'no-transformer kit'. The panel is double-sided (see images) in case you want a change of view.

If you're a fan of Doctor Who, or those 50s-60s SciFi shows, then you'll know the sound!

!> Note: This is not a *precision* device! Depending upon which input you use as 'carrier' and which you use for 'modulator' there is likely to be some breakthrough of sound, experimentation is the key.

## Controls

* **volume** controls the output level.

## Connectivity

Not many active connections - mainly passive-multiples!

### Inputs

* **A & B** - Signal into the ring modulator (experiment with swapping them over to minimise signal breakthrough)

### Outputs

* **X** The ring modulated output - e.g *A*x*B*
