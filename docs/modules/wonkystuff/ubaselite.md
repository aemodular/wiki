## Overview

* Module format: single-width, full height
* Power consumption: ??mA

The wonkystuff&reg; &mu;BaseLite is a minimal version of the UBASE from Tangible Waves — since none of the wonkystuff&reg; modules use the various bus signals available on the UBASE, they've done away with the switches and signal routing, just providing power to the attached modules.

Version 1.2 also contains a small 'tell-tale' LED to verify that it is correctly connected to the bus ribbon-cable.

## Controls

None

## Connectivity

Three 6-pin headers for micro-module connection.
