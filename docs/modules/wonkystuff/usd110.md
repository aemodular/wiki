## Overview

* Module format: micro-module
* Power consumption: 5mA

[filename](../../common/micro.md ':include')

This module is a micro-module version of the popular [sd110](/modules/wonkystuff/sd110.md) clone of the Snare voice from the Boss DR-110 drum machine. In the translation to micro-module, the 'balance' control has been lost, however all other circuitry is present and correct - all of the same sound generation, in 1/3 of the size!

## Controls

* **body tone** controls the pitch of the drum body, equivalent to tuning the drum skin itself;
* **noise decay** controls the 'tightness' of the snare's noise burst, from a taut snap to a loose splash.

## Connectivity

As a drum voice, this one is fairly self-explanatory!

### Inputs

* **T** A trigger input is provided as a pair of sockets (acting as a local multiple).

### Outputs

* **SD** the mixed 'complete' snare tone, as adjusted by the *balance* control;
* **D** the body tone on its own;
* **S** the snare sound on its own
