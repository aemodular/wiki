## Overview

* Module format: micro-module
* Power consumption: &lt;1mA

[filename](../../common/micro.md ':include')

Here’s something that’s a bit different! One of the *wonkystuff crew* is a big fan of Eric Archer’s *micro space rockers* – an analog percussion generator designed in 2009. I contacted Eric (now trading as [rarewaves llc](https://rarewaves.net/)) and he was gracious enough to license the design to wonkystuff for use in the AE Modular format.

This is supplied as a kit, with a selection of 17 capacitors to reproduce most of Eric’s original examples.

## Controls

There are no controls, as such, rather the sound is changed by swapping in different capacitor values to the three front-panel locations. c1 and c2 affect the sound generation, whilst c3 affects the decay of the sounds (larger == longer).

## Connectivity

### Inputs

* **in** trigger or gate as you see fit (maybe even audio?) - have a play!

### Outputs

* **out** Sonic wonderment!
